# Hero's-Journal
CS 4322 Fall 2018 Semester Project

**Hero's Journal** is an android app that allows users to build to do lists that, when checked off, will increase the stats of an attribute of a digital roleplaying avatar of the user. Basic Hero's Journal to-do functionality includes adding new tasks, editing, deleting an existing task, and  reminders through alerts. Hero's Journal roleplaying functionality includes creating a personal digital sprite, customizing the sprite, tagging tasks with attributes (expanded upon in user stories), and increasing attribute stats with completing stats.
